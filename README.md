How it works:
- Select the folder containing the ZFB files from the "Select Folder" button.
- From the "Path" column, double click with the mouse to edit the text.
- From the "Download IMG" button you can download the desired image.
- From the "Change IMG" button you can select another image that you want with the size you want, since it will resize automatically.
- From the "Save" button save the image change.

Additional explanation: It is designed for ZFB with images of size 640X480 (hyper screen) and 144X208.

The size and position of the image must be configured in Foldername.ini/FoldernamX.ini:

For example, for full screen the configuration will be: 0 0 640 480
Remember, once the ZFB files have been hosted in their destination (FC, SFC, MD etc.), use the "Game List Updater" program to update the game list.
